## Accessibility Report

#### Equitable Use:

Our program web app is designed such that all users can have the same experience when using it. We ensured this by creating a GUI with high contrast colors to minimize readability issues for colorblind users.

#### Flexibility in Use:

Our program gives users flexibility by allowing them to access our program from any device via the web. Furthermore, our program acknowledges that users have many different ways of relating to tasks. This is why we offer the user to schedule three different kinds of tasks: fixed tasks, non-fixed tasks, and projects. Each of these kinds of tasks seek to meet a different user need.

#### Simple and Intuitive Use:

We made sure that our application was simple and intuitive by designing it such that the language used when prompting the user to undertake actions such as signing in or changing their schedule are simple and infromative enough that the user will not nned a tutorial for the website. This was done by eliminating all unnecessary complexity, labeling buttons with clear instructions, and offering clear and concise alterts to notify users of common errors.

#### Perceptible information: 

The website we made was designed with the perceptibility of information as one of our main objectives. This was done by making the font size large enough and choosing a font that was legible. We also differentiated the various elements of the pages into clear sections and prompts that can be easily described and are thus conducie to easily giving instructions or directions. We also created the GUI with colors that contrast highly so that all information is clearly perceptible.

#### Tolerance for Error: 

Users of our website can feel safe knowing that it tries to prevent most errors that they may make. For example, all buttons on the webpages are big enough and far away from each other so that users do not accidentaly press a button they did not intend to press. The buttons also have padding around them for misclicks.
Additionally, we have alerts built to help the user identify common mistakes that might prevent the program from running as desired (e.g. the user provides the wrong password and thus cannot sign in).

#### Low Physical Effort:

The program is designed to minimizes the physical effort the user has to put in by minimizing repetitive actions. This is part of the idea behind scheduling projects, where the program asks you questions about one large task and then breaks it down and schedules it in multiple slots over a window of time so that the user does not have to do so manually.
Our program requires no large amounts of scrolling or typing. Each scheduling process consists of a few buttons and short text-entries, requiring low physical effort. Furthermore, our program saves each task as it is scheduled, so that the user does not need to undergo the physical strain of sitting or standing in a single location due to application usage, if they do not want to.

#### Size and Space for Approach and Use

Of course, we did our best to ensure that the app is easy to use. A big part of why we chose to use chose to use a web application is that it enables our program to be run on all sorts of devices to suit the user needs. Our program will scale to any device screen and so can meet the size and space for approach for use that the user builds into their preferred web surfing environment. Our html is compatible with text to speech for those who cannot interact with the text on the screen.

### Target Market

Overall, we think that our program should be marketed towards people who could make use of an app that schedules their day for them. This category is mostly made up of people who have busy days and are looking for a way to automate the process of scheduling their weeks. In general, this would include people like students, who often have workloads that they do not know how to handle, and professionals in fields that have lots of business meetings and events that they need to keep track of. One demographic we specifically had in mind while scheduling our program are people who have difficulty deciding how to manage thier time. The ability of the system to schedule non-fixed tasks and projects allows the user to accomplish their tasks in time without needing to decide where to put them in thier schedule. This epxerience was inspired by some teammates experience meeting with learning strategists who perform a similar function.

### Demographics

In general, it does not seem that any demographic would be more or less likely to use or program. It is possible that people who do not have busy schedules might not have much use of our app. In addition, anyone who is picky about the way they like to complete projects (for example, someone who likes to complete all the tasks for a project in the morning, a feature which is not yet part of our program) might prefer to not use our website. Our hope is that in connecting to the web we make our program accessible to most users, but there are likely certain demographics that would still be excluded be our program (e.g. if the web does not allow the user to input without typing directly this would affect users with motor issues).
