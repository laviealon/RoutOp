## Accessibility Report

#### Equitable Use:

Our program web app is designed such that all users can have the same experience when using it. We ensured this by creating a gui with colors with high contrast so that colorblind users have no dificulty with it.

#### Flexibility in Use:

Our program gives users flexibility by allowing them to schedule their tasks very flexibly. We ensured this by giving the user the ability to modify their schedule by canceling or editing tasks and projects whenever they want.

#### Simple and Intuitive Use:

We made sure that our application was simple and that users could intuitively use it by designing it such that the language used when prompting the user to undertake actions such as signing in or changing their schedule without needing a tutorial for the website. This was done by eliminating all unnecessary complexity.

#### Perceptible information: 

The website we made was designed with the perceptibility of information as one of our main tasks. This was done by making the font size large enough and choosing a font that was legible. We also differentiated the various elements of the pages in ways that can be described to make it easy to give instructions or directions. We also created the gui with colors that contrast highly so that all information is clearly perceptible.

#### Tolerance for Error: 

Users of our website can feel safe knowing that it tries to prevent most errors that they may make. For example, all buttons on the webpages are big enough and far away from each other so that users do not accidentaly press a button they did not intend to press. The buttons also have padding around them for misclicks.
Additionally, we have error popups for incorrect passwords.

#### Low Physical Effort:

The program is designed to minimizes the physical effort the user has to put in by minimizing repetitive actions. This is part of the idea behind scheduling projects, where the program asks you questions about one large task and then breaks it down and schedules it in multiple slots over a window of time so that the user does not have to do so manually.
Our program requires no large amounts of scrolling or typing. Each scheduling process consists of a few buttons and short text-entries, requiring low physical effort. Furthermore, our program can be saved an exited after any task is scheduled, so that the user does not need to undergo the physical strain of sitting or standing in a single location due to application usage, if they do not want to.

(For  example, instead of having to add multiple tasks for each day to the schedule for a routine (e.g. adding 7 tasks called "workout"), the user can add one task and say that they want to do it everyday.

#### Size and Space for Approach and Use

Of course, we did our best to ensure that the app is easy to use. A big part of why we chose to use chose to use a web application is that it enables our program to be run on all sorts of devices to suit the user needs. Our program will scale to any device screen and so can meet the size and space for approach for use that the user builds into their preferred web surfing environment.

(In our html documents, we complied with semantic HTML by using \<header>, \<main>, and \<footer> to allow users using screen readers to understand what the page is representing.)




### Target Market

Overall, we think that our program should be marketed towards people who could make use of an app that schedules their day for them. This category is mostly made up of people who have busy days and are looking for a way to automate the process of scheduling their weeks. In general, this would include people like students, who often have workloads that they do not know how to handle, and professionals in fields that have lots of business meetings and events that they need to keep track of.

### Demographics

In general, it does not seem that any demographic would be more or less likely to use or program. It is possible that people who do not have busy schedules might not have much use of our app. In addition, anyone who is picky about the way they like to complete projects (for example, someone who likes to complete all the tasks for a project in the morning, a feature which is not yet part of our program) might prefer to not use our website.
