## Accessibility Report

This report provides an overview of the accessibility standards incorporated in the RoutOp software to comply with WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) 2.

#### 1. Equitable Use:

Our program's web application has been designed to provide a consistent user experience for all users. To ensure this, we have employed a high contrast graphical user interface (GUI) to minimize readability issues for colorblind users.

#### 2. Flexibility in Use:

Our program is designed to provide users with a high degree of flexibility by enabling them to access it from any device through the web. In addition, we recognize that users have diverse preferences for managing their tasks. To address this, we offer three distinct task scheduling options, namely fixed tasks, non-fixed tasks, and projects, each catering to specific user needs.

#### 3. Simple and Intuitive Use:

We ensured the simplicity and intuitiveness of our application by crafting its language in a straightforward and informative manner. This approach eliminates the need for users to undergo tutorials when navigating the website. Our strategy involved streamlining complexity, providing clear button labels with instructions, and issuing concise alerts to notify users of any typical errors.

#### 4. Perceptible information: 

RoutOp was deliberately designed with a focus on ensuring the perceptibility of information. We accomplished this by using a legible font that is large enough to be easily read. We also created clear sections and prompts, allowing for simple and effective instructions or directions to be provided. Additionally, we employed high-contrast colors throughout the GUI to ensure that all information is easily distinguishable.

#### 5. Tolerance for Error: 

Our website prioritizes user safety by implementing measures to minimize errors that may occur while using the platform. This includes designing all buttons on the webpages to be adequately spaced apart, and of sufficient size, thus preventing accidental clicking. Furthermore, the buttons are enclosed by padding to prevent misclicks. Additionally, our system is equipped with alerts that enable users to identify and rectify common errors that may prevent the program from functioning as expected. For instance, in cases where the user provides an incorrect password, the system promptly notifies them, thereby ensuring a smooth user experience.

#### 6. Low Physical Effort:

The program has been designed with the aim of reducing physical strain on the user by minimizing repetitive actions. To achieve this, we have incorporated the scheduling of projects feature, where the program prompts the user with questions about a large task and automatically breaks it down into smaller parts scheduled over a specified time period. This eliminates the need for manual input and reduces physical effort. Our program also features an intuitive interface with minimal scrolling and typing requirements, which involves a few buttons and short text-entries, further reducing physical strain. Additionally, the program saves each task as it is scheduled, allowing users to access it from anywhere and reducing the need for prolonged use in a single location.

#### 7. Size and Space for Approach and Use

We made concerted efforts to ensure that our application is user-friendly. We opted to develop a web application to enable its use across a wide range of devices to cater to diverse user needs. The program is designed to dynamically adjust to various screen sizes, ensuring compatibility with the user's preferred device and screen settings. Additionally, we made the HTML compatible with text-to-speech technology to facilitate access for users who may not be able to interact with the text on the screen.

### 8. Target Market

Our program is particularly well-suited for individuals who require assistance in organizing their busy schedules. This demographic includes students, who may struggle with managing their academic workload, and professionals with demanding schedules filled with numerous meetings and events. We also designed our program with individuals who may have difficulty making decisions about time management in mind. The scheduling feature for non-fixed tasks and projects helps users accomplish their goals without having to decide when to fit them into their schedule. Our inspiration for this feature came from the experiences of our team members who met with learning strategists that offered similar services.

### 9. Demographics

In general, it appears that the usefulness of our program is not limited by any specific demographic. However, it is possible that individuals who do not have hectic schedules may not find our program as valuable. Additionally, those who have specific preferences regarding task completion, such as completing all tasks for a project in the morning, may not be able to fully utilize our current program. While our web-based platform aims to make the program accessible to most users, there may still be certain demographics who are unable to use it due to limitations, such as individuals with motor impairments that prevent direct typing.
